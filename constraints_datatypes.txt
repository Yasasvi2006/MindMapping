What are Constraints? (Easy Meaning)
    Constraints are limits given in a problem that help determine:
    How large or small the data values can be
    Which data type should be used
    Which algorithm will be efficient
    Whether overflow or runtime errors may occur
    Reading constraints carefully is essential before designing a solution.

Types of Constraints (Simple Explanation)
1) Range Constraint
    Specifies the minimum and maximum values a variable can take.
    Example:
    1 ≤ n ≤ 100000

2) Size Constraint
    Limits the size of data structures such as arrays or strings.
    Example:
    Array size ≤ 1000
3) Time Constraint
    Indicates that the program must execute within a fixed time limit, requiring an efficient algorithm.
    Examples:
    Small input size → O(n²) may be acceptable
    Large input size → Prefer O(n) or O(n log n)

4) Space Constraint
    Restricts the amount of memory (RAM) the program can use.

5) Input Constraint
    Defines rules for input format, such as number of inputs, data types, and input structure.

Java Primitive Data Types (Easy Table)
Data Type	Size	Range / Information
byte	1 byte	-128 to 127
short	2 bytes	-32,768 to 32,767
int	4 bytes	-2³¹ to (2³¹ − 1) ≈ ±2.1 × 10⁹
long	8 bytes	-2⁶³ to (2⁶³ − 1)
float	4 bytes	Precision of about 7 decimal digits
double	8 bytes	Precision of about 15 decimal digits
char	2 bytes	0 to 65,535 (Unicode values)
boolean	JVM dependent	true or false
How to Choose Data Type Using Constraints?

    If value ≤ 10⁹ → use int
    If value ≤ 10¹² → use long
    For decimal values → use double
    For character data → use char
    For logical values (true/false) → use boolean
    Using an incorrect data type may lead to overflow or incorrect results.
Overflow Example (Very Important)
int x = 2147483647;
x = x + 1;
System.out.println(x);
Output:
    -2147483648
Explanation:
    The value exceeds the maximum limit of int, causing integer overflow and wrapping around to the minimum possible value.
